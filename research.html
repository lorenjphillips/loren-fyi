								<p>During my time at UCSD, I had the opportunity to work in the Jacobs School of Engineering's Advanced Manufacturing Lab. This experience was incredibly valuable as it allowed me to gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge manufacturing technologies and processes. I was able to work on various projects that involved additive manufacturing, CNC machining, and other advanced manufacturing techniques. The lab environment was dynamic and challenging, pushing me to think critically and creatively to solve complex problems. I was fortunate to work alongside experienced researchers and engineers who provided guidance and mentorship throughout my time there. This experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also taught me the importance of collaboration and effective communication in a research setting.</p>

								<p>One of the most significant projects I worked on was developing a new method for 3D printing complex geometries using a novel material. This project required me to design and build custom fixtures, develop new printing parameters, and conduct extensive testing to optimize the process. Through this work, I gained valuable experience in experimental design, data analysis, and technical writing. I also had the opportunity to present my findings at a local conference, which helped me develop my presentation skills and network with other researchers in the field.</p>
								<p>Another highlight of my research experience was collaborating with a team of graduate students on a project focused on improving the efficiency of CNC machining operations. This project involved developing new tool paths and cutting strategies to reduce machining time while maintaining part quality. I learned a great deal about process optimization and the importance of considering multiple factors when making engineering decisions. The project was challenging but rewarding, and I was proud to see our improvements implemented in the lab's manufacturing processes.</p>
								<p>Overall, my research experience at UCSD was incredibly valuable and helped me develop both technical and professional skills that will be beneficial in my future career. I am grateful for the opportunity to work in such a dynamic and challenging environment, and I look forward to applying the knowledge and skills I gained to future projects.</p>
